    Based on https://github.com/scverse/squidpy version 1.2.2
    This function will also smooth the image via ``process``

    :param img: ``ImageContainer`` High-resolution image.
    :param layer: Image layer in img that should be processed. If None and only 1 layer is present, it will be selected.
    :param library_id: Name of the Z-dimension(s) that this function should be applied to. 
        For not specified Z-dimensions, the identity function is applied. 
        If None, all Z-dimensions are segmented separately.
    :param method: Segmentation method to use. Valid options are:
        ``watershed`` - skimage.segmentation.watershed().
        Alternatively, any callable() can be passed as long as it has the following signature: 
        ``numpy.ndarray (height, width, channels)`` -> ``numpy.ndarray (height, width[, channels])``
    :param channel: Channel index to use for segmentation. If None, use all channels.
    :param chunks: Number of chunks for dask. For automatic chunking, use chunks = 'auto'.
    :param lazy: Whether to lazily compute the result or not. Only used when chunks != None.
    :param layer_added: Layer of new image layer to add into img object. If None, use 'segmented_{model}'.
    :param thresh: Threshold for creation of masked image. The areas to segment should be contained in this mask. If None, it is determined by Otsuâ€™s method. Only used if method = 'watershed'.
    :param geq: Treat thresh as upper or lower bound for defining areas to segment. 
        If geq = True, mask is defined as mask = arr >= thresh, meaning high values in arr denote areas to segment. 
        Only used if method = 'watershed'.
    :param copy: If True, return the result, otherwise save it to the image container.
    :param kwargs: Keyword arguments for the underlying model.
    :return: If copy = True, returns a new container with the segmented image in '{layer_added}'.
        Otherwise, modifies the img with the following key:
        ``squidpy.im.ImageContainer ['{layer_added}']``
