### About simulated test data

The test data is located in the `_data` directory. Some data files were generated by simulations. To run tests quicker 
the simulation reuslts are stored in the repository and not rerun. If there are changes in the simulation code, the test 
data should be updated. The data can be regenerated with the `generate_data.py` script:

```bash
cd _data
python generate_data.py
```

Note: this should only be done if you are sure that the simulation code is correct and the data should be updated.
